# ProcessPulse
A general-purpose monitoring tool

I am trying to build a generic observability tool which can be integrated with the existing observability platforms.

The longer aim is to have two pieces to this:
1. A light-weight observer piece that can run anywhere, track the required processes and report back to the server.
2. An in-house centralized server that can consolidate the information.

Since I am currently learning Rust, I will be starting with very basic code and then try to convert it to a full-fledged software.
